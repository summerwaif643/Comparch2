# Pure-RISC-V-Reference
RISC-V Reference and notes taken from sapienza university, written in LaTeX.
I hope this helps for all those students which find themselves in an academic course studying the RISC V architecture and instructions. Since it's meant for starters, this reference
includes basic exercises with sources and explanations when possible. 
Please do mind that this was done by a student and may contain some errors. Feel free to point out some issues or add missing content yourself.
